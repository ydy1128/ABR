Assembly Breakpoint Recovery

This python program (using pyxed module) gets an input program (program.exe) and transform the exe file into hex string.
Using the pyxed module, the program will generate assembly instructions with the hex string.
The program has two outputs: breakpoints with increasing breakpoint line number or random line number.
Graphs with sample outputs are attached below
